Tag Vs Element
    Tag represents Either Opening / Closing tags
    But Element is complete Entity with content 
    Element = Open tag + Content + Close tag

Elements are of 2 types:
    - Inline Elements - 
    - Block Elements

Block Elements- Always starts in a Newline They wont allow anyother elements beside them
    EG: ALL HEAdings, div, p

Inline Elements: Will continue the control and they allow Other elements beside them.
    eg: a, img, span

**div and span are container elements and they are used to combine multiple elements 

SEMENATIC Elements:
    These are used to make the html code more structured and easy to understand for search engines
    there are so many elemenets and each serve different purpose
    Eg: header, nav,footer, aside, article, main, figure etc.. 

    non semantic 
     <div> text </div>

    semantic:
        <section> text </section>


CLASS and ID's:
    Class and Id's aer the attiributes given to at particular element to identify the element.
    Classes are used to identify the multiple lements at at time 
    ID is used to identify the element uniquely
    One Element can have multiple calss names and multiple elememnents can have same class name.
    ID's are always unique

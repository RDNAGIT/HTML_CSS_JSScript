Grid is used to arrange the elements in tow dimensions i.e. rows and columns
This is also used for complex layouts using grid lines such as rowlines and column lines
Parent Properties:
    display-grid : arrange child items fit in the grid
    grid-template-columns: col1-width col2-widht etc..
    
    mention each column width to divide as columns:
    100px 100px / repeat(2, 100px)/ 50 % 50% / 1fr 1fr 

    grid-template -rows: row1-width row2-width etc..
    mention each row-heith to divide as rows
    100px 100px / repeat(2, 100px)/ 50 % 50% / 1fr 1fr 

    justify-conten: which will move items in horixontal direction 
    align-items: which will move items in vertical direction
    gap: gap between the items)row-gap/ column-gap)

    child properties:
        grid is divided as per row lines and column lines i.e 3 rows will have 4 row lines
        and 4 columns will have 4 column lines

        grid-row-start: starting row line number 
        grid-row-end: ending row line number
        grid-column-start: starting column line number 
        grid-column-end: ending column line number
        grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-start-end
        grid-column: grid-column-start/grid-clumn-end
        grid-area: grid-row-start/grid-column-start/grid-row-end/grid-column-end
        order: by default order is zero. We can specify each one element order

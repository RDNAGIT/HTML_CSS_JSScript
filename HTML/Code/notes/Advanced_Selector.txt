we can use any element using tagname, classname and IDname
but we also have other ways of selection as below:
    -Child selector
            We can select any immediate child of parent using arrow [>] eg: 
            eg: div>p{color:red; }
            p immediate inside of div have color red
    -Descendent selector: 
            we can select any element who is descendent of another element using space[' ']
            eg: div p{ color:red}
            p is the descendent of p
    -Sibling selector: We can select any element which comes right after the other element
    using +
        h1+p{
            color: red
        }
    p coming after next to h1

pseudo selector: 
    We can select elements based on its state or position using : OR :: 
    pseudo classes: 
        a.: hover: works when you keep your mouse cursor over element.
        b.:link
            :active: works when you click 
            :visited - works when you already visisted the achor tag
        c.:required-- selects all inuts which have required
            -:Optional-- selects all inputs which are not required
            -:readonly -- selects all inputs which are readonly
            -:readwrite -- selects all inputs which are NOT readonly
            -:disabled -- selects all inputs which are disabled
            -:enabled -- selects all inputs which are enabled

Pseudo elements:
    These are special selectors which are mentioned followed by :: 
    i. ::placeholder -- Used to select placeholder or a input
    ii. ::before - used to select or give content before an element. For Assigning content,
        we can use 'content' property with unicodes.
    iii. ::after - used to select or give content after an element.

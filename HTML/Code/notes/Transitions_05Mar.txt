Transition: are used to show the transformation of an element from one state to another state
Eg: An element increases its height or an element which changes its position

syntax: transition: transition-property transition-duration timing-function

transition property: We can write properties which we need to observe transforming its state
OR we can mention "all" 

duration: we can mention time in seconds or milliseconds

timing-function: We can mention timing functions like:
    ease -- grows with gradual speed 
    ease-in -- intially slow but later fast
    ease-out -- initially fast but later slow
    ease-in-out - slow fast slow
    linear -- maintains constant speed

we can use multiple properties for better transitions such as transform, filter,
opacity etc.. 
    transform-properties containts multiple elements like
        scale -- Used for zooming and scale(1) is 100%
        translate -- used for moving the element and translateX(200px) moves the 
                    element to 200px on x-axis
        rotate(deg) -- used for rotating an element 
        skew() -- used for dragging element with corners

    
There are so many filters like grayscale, saturate, blur, opacity , hue_rotate etc...
